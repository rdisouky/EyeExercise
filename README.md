# EyeExercise
 Course Project: An eye that moves with the cursor of the mouse following not only the direction but also the speed of the cursor
 
How to Run: 
- Clone this repository
- Open index.html file
- Enjoy!

Roadmap of future improvements: I am hoping to add multiple eyes to have them all move at the same time but the trick is that if the cursor goes to the middle of the screen, all eyes on the left hand side should look right and all the eyes on the right hand side should look left! A Collage of Eyes!
